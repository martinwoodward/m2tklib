Implementation Plan

1) Menu Structure
2) Track-Point DB Design
    Initial List with tracks (128?), then double linked list with track points
3) Various main display modes
4) Math for compass module


===============


- the four map positions are showed correctly in the list, 
  but during edit, the wong values are used
