Implementation Plan

1) Menu Structure
2) Track-Point DB Design
    Initial List with tracks (128?), then double linked list with track points
3) Various main display modes
4) Math for compass module


===============


- the four map positions are showed correctly in the list, 
  but during edit, the wong values are used
--> more or less fixed

- convert back from sexagesimal format
  --> ok
- other map displays (etc speed)
  --> done
- format exmem?
  --> not requred, instead allow to zero the position
- edit target identifier
  --> done
- draw circle for special targets
  --> done (not tested)
- display sats, battery, time(?) on all screens 
  --> sat & bat
  
- create_gps_pos_string(&(pq.interface.pos)); in GPS Stat übernehmen
  --> done
- time is UTC: new pref. correct by +/- h 

- edit pos: zero or current pos: preferences 
  better: [0] [x]
  copy from pq.interface.pos
  --> done, testing required
  
- Add N,S,E,W to fractional from (instead of sign)
  --> done

- degree symbol not show, change font?

- low power modes?
